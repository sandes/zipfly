        # Buzon - ZipFly
        
        ZipFly is a zip archive generator based on zipfile.py.
        It was created by Buzon.io to generate very large ZIP archives for immediate sending out to clients, or for writing large ZIP archives without memory inflation.
        
        # Requirements
        Python 3.6+
        
        # Install
            pip3 install zipfly
        
        # Basic usage, compress on-the-fly during writes
        Basic use case is compressing on the fly. Some data will be buffered by the zipfile deflater, but memory inflation is going to be very constrained. Data will be written to destination at fairly regular intervals.
        
        `ZipFly` defaults arguments:<br>    
        - <b>paths:</b> [ ] <br/>
        - <b>mode:</b> (write) w <br/>
        - <b>chunksize:</b> (bytes) 16384 <br/>
        - <b>compression:</b> Stored <br/>
        - <b>allowZip64:</b> True <br/>
        - <b>compresslevel:</b> None <br/>
        - <b>storesize:</b> (bytes) 0 <br/>
        
        
        <br/>
        
        `paths` <b>list of dictionaries:</b>
        
        - `fs` (filesystem): `path from your disk`<br>
        - `n` (name): `add a custom file path in the zip file` <i>(Optional)</i>
        
        
        ```python
            
            import zipfly
            
            paths = [
                {
                    'fs': '/path/to/large/file'
                },
            ]
        
            # ZipFly
            zfly = zipfly.ZipFly( paths = paths )
        
            with open("large.zip", "wb") as f:
                for i in zfly.generator():
                    f.write(i)
        
        ```
        # Examples
        
        > <b>Streaming multiple files in a zip with Django or Flask</b>
        Send forth large files to clients with the most popular frameworks
        
        > <b>Create paths</b>
        Easy way to create the array `paths` from a parent folder.
        
        > <b>Predict the size of the zip file before creating it</b>
        Use the `BufferPredictionSize` to compute the correct size of the resulting archive before creating it.
        
        > <b>Streaming a large file</b>
        Efficient way to read a single very large binary file in python
        
        > <b>Set a comment</b>
        Your own comment in the zip file
